= Configuration options

There are a large number of configuration options
that can be set in the input script.
The options are set in the input script by adding
lines of the form:

 config.option = value

Here are all of the available configuration options and the default
values if left unset.
Note you do not have to set all of these values in the
input script.
In a typical input script, one might set 10-15 input variables.


== Geometry

[#config-dimensions]
`config.dimensions` ::
     _int_, default: `2` +
    Spatial dimensionality, 2 or 3

`config.axisymmetric` ::
    _bool_, default: `false` +
    Sets axisymmetric mode for 2D geometries.
    The axis of rotation aligns with the x-axis (at y=0).


== Time-stepping

`config.gasdynamic_update_scheme` ::
  _string_, default: `'predictor-corrector'` +
  The options are: `'euler'`, `'pc'`, `'predictor-corrector'`,
  `'midpoint'`, `'classic-rk3'`, `'tvd-rk3'`, `'denman-rk3'`,
  `'moving-grid-1-stage'`, `'moving-grid-2-stage'`,
  `'backward_euler'`, `'implicit_rk1'`.
  Most of the update schemes are explicit, except for the last two listed here.
  Note that `'pc'` is equivalent to `'predictor-corrector'`.
  If you want time-accurate solutions, use a two- or three-stage explicit stepping scheme,
  otherwise, (explicit) Euler stepping has less computational expense
  but you may get less accuracy and the code will not be as robust for the same CFL value.
  For example the shock front in the Sod shock tube example is quite noisy for Euler
  stepping at CFL=0.85 but is quite neat with any of the two- or three-stage stepping schemes
  at the same value of CFL.
  The explicit midpoint and predictor-corrector schemes produce a tidy shock up to CFL = 1.0
  and the rk3 schemes still look tidy up to CFL = 1.2.
  If you care mainly about the end result, you might be able to use an implicit scheme
  with larger CFL number.
  We have run the `'backward_euler'` scheme up to a CFL value of 50 for some of
  the turbulent flat-plate examples.
  The implicit schemes are more expensive than the low-order explicit schemes, per time-step
  and, at large CFL numbers, will not be time accurate.
  The trade-off will be something that you have to explore but, if you care only about
  a steady state, the `'backward_euler'` scheme may get you there more quickly than any
  of the explicit schemes.
  Your mileage _will_ vary.
  Note that you may use dashes or underscores when spelling the scheme names.

`config.fixed_time_step` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  Normally, we allow the time step size to be determined from cell conditions and CFL number.
  Setting `config.fixed_time_step=true` forces the time step size to be unchanged from
  `config.dt_init`.

`config.cfl_value` ::
  _float_, default: `0.5` +
  The CFL number is ratio of the time-step divided by the time
  for the fastest signal to cross a cell.
  The time-step adjustment process tries to set the time-step for the overall simulation
  to a value such that the maximum CFL number for any cell is at this `cfl_value`.
  If you are having trouble with a simulation that has lots of sudden flow field changes,
  decreasing the size of `cfl_value` may help.

`config.cfl_schedule` ::
  _table of float pairs_, default `{{0.0, config.cfl_value},}` +
  If you want to vary the `cfl_value` as the simulation proceeds,
  possibly starting with small values and then increasing them as the flow field
  settles to something not too difficult for the flow solver,
  you can specify a table of `{time,cfl_value}` pairs that are interpolated by the solver.
  Outside the specified range of times, the `cfl_value` will be the closest end-point value.

`config.dt_init` ::
  _float_, default: `1.0e-3` +
  Although the computation of the time step size is usually automatic,
  there might be cases where this process does not select a small enough value to get the
  simulation started stably.
  For the initial step, the user may override the computed value of time step by assigning
  a suitably small value to `config.dt_init`.
  This will then be the initial time step (in seconds) that will be used for the
  first few steps of the simulation process.
  Be careful to set a value small enough for the time-stepping to be stable.
  Since the time stepping is synchronous across all parts of the flow domain,
  this time step size should be smaller than half of the smallest time for a signal
  (pressure wave) to cross any cell in the flow domain.
  If you are sure that your geometric and boundary descriptions are correct but your simulation
  fails for no clear reason, try setting the initial time step to a very small value.
  For some simulations of viscous hypersonic flow on fine grids,
  it is not unusual to require time steps to be as small as a nanosecond.

`config.dt_max` ::
  _float_, default: `1.0e-3` +
  Maximum allowable time step (in seconds).
  Sometimes, especially when strong source terms are at play, the CFL-based time-step
  determination does not suitably limit the size of the allowable time step.
  This parameter allows the user to limit the maximum time step directly.

`config.viscous_signal_factor` ::
  _float_, default: `1.0` +
  By default, the full viscous effect for the signal
  calculation will be used within the time-step calculation.
  It has been suggested that the full viscous effect may not be needed
  to ensure stable calculations for highly-resolved viscous calculations.
  A value of `0.0` will completely suppress the viscous contribution to
  the signal speed calculation but you may end up with unstable stepping.
  It's a matter of _try a value and see_ if you get a larger time-step
  while retaining a stable simulation.

`config.stringent_cfl` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  The default action for structured grids is to use different cell widths
  in each index direction.
  Setting `config.stringent_cfl=true` will use the smallest cross-cell distance
  in the time-step size check.

`config.cfl_count` ::
  _int_, default: `10` +
  The number of time steps between checks of the size of the time step.
  This check is expensive so we don't want to do it too frequently but, then,
  we have to be careful that the flow does not develop suddenly and
  the time step become unstable.

`config.max_time` ::
  _float_, default: `1.0e-3` +
  The simulation will be terminated on reaching this value of time.

`config.max_step` ::
  _int_, default: `100` +
  The simulation will be terminated on reaching this number of time steps.
  You will almost certainly want to use a larger value, however,
  a small value is a good way to test the starting process of a simulation, to see that
  all seems to be in order.

`config.dt_plot` ::
  _float_, default: `1.0e-3` +
  The whole flow solution will be written to disk when
  this amount of simulation time has elapsed, and then again,
  each occasion the same increment of simulation time has elapsed.

`config.dt_history` ::
  _float_, default: `1.0e-3` +
  The history-point data will be written to disk repeatedly,
  each time this increment of simulation time has elapsed.
  To obtain history data, you will also need to specify one or more history points.

`config.with_local_time_stepping` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  If a steady-state solution is sought, then it is possible to accelerate
  the explicit time-stepping scheme by allowing each cell in the domain
  to integrate in time with their own time-step that satisfies only the local CFL condition.
  This is sometimes referred to as Local Time-Stepping (LTS).
  Setting `config.with_local_time_stepping=true` enables this mode of time-stepping.
  Note that this mode of time-stepping is only suitable for steady-state simulations.

`config.local_time_stepping_limit_factor` ::
  _int_, default: `10000` +
  To improve the stability of simulations that enable `config.with_local_time_stepping`,
  users can limit the largest allowable local time-step as a function
  of the smallest global time-step.
  The allowable time-step for each cell is set to be the minimum of the cell's local time-step
  and the global minimum time-step multiplied by `config.local_time_stepping_limit_factor`.
  The `config.local_time_stepping_limit_factor` is typically set to a value between 500 and 10000.

`config.residual_smoothing` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  Residual smoothing essentially applies an averaging filter on the residuals
  during the time-integration procedure.
  Residual smoothing has two advantages: (1) The averaging increases the allowable CFL
  for a particular explicit time-stepping scheme; and (2) The averaging ensures that
  the local time-step for two adjacent cells doesn't differ by a large magnitude
  when using `config.with_local_time_stepping`, this has a stabilising effect.

`config.residual_smoothing_type` ::
  _string_, default: `'explicit'` +
  The options are: `'explicit'`, `'implicit'`.
  When `config.residual_smoothing=true`, the residuals can either be smoothed
  via an explicit averaging method or an implicit averaging method.
  Explicit averaging has less computational expense, however, implicit averaging
  typically results in a larger stable time step.

`config.residual_smoothing_weight` ::
  _float_, default: `0.2` +
  A weighting factor used in the residual averaging when `config.residual_smoothing=true`.

`config.residual_smoothing_iterations` ::
  _int_, default: `2` +
  The number of Jacobi iterations used for the implicit residual averaging
  when `config.residual_smoothing=true` and `config.residual_smoothing_type='implicit'`.

== Block marching

`config.block_marching` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  Normal time iteration proceeds on all blocks simultaneously, however,
  such a time-marching calulation may be very expensive computationally.
  Setting `config.block_marching=true` enables a sequencing of the time integration
  such that at any one instant, only two slices of blocks are being integrated.
  The i-direction is the marching direction and the assumed dominant (supersonic) flow direction.
  The blocks are assumed to be in a regular array
  with a fixed number of blocks in the j- and k-directions to the entire flow domain.

`config.nib`, `config.njb`, `config.nkb` ::
  _int_ default: `1`, `1`, `1` +
  are the number of blocks in each index direction.
  To make the best of block marching, you should have `config.nib` set to a fairly large number.
  Since the array of blocks is assumed regular, you cannot have very complicated geometries.
  Simple ducts, nozzles and plates are the intended applications.
  As seen in the examples, it may be convenient to define the full domain with one or more calls
  to the constructor `FBArray:new`.
  There is a restriction that the overall flow domain be assembled as
  a single structured array of `FlowBlock` objects.

`config.propagate_inflow_data` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  By default, the integration begins in each set of blocks
  from the initial gas state set up in the preparation phase of the simulation.
  Some advantage may be gained following integration of the first block slices by initializing
  subsequent block slices with the downstream (east boundary) flow states.
  Setting `config.propagate_inflow_data=true` propagates these data across each new block slice,
  before the integration process for the slice begins.

`config.save_intermediate_results` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  Usually, a single set of solution files
  (after marching over all block slices) is all that is required.
  Sometimes, when debugging a troublesome calculation, it may be useful to have a solution
  written after the time-integration process for each pair of block slices.
  Set this parameter `true` to get these intermediate solutions written.


== Spatial reconstruction

`config.interpolation_order` ::
  _int_, default: `2` +
  Before applying the flux calculator, high-order reconstruction is applied.
  Setting `config.interpolation_order=1` results in no reconstruction
  of intra-cell flow properties.

`config.interpolation_delay` ::
  _float_, default: `0.0` +
  The time (in seconds) to wait before increasing the interpolation order.
  If the delay is enabled, the simulation will begin using `interpolation_order=1`.
  After the delay time, the interpolation order will switch to that specified in
  the configuration.
  This delay is useful to help with robustness during transient starts because the
  first order spatial reconstruction is very reliable (albeit less accurate as compared
  to high order reconstruction).

`config.apply_limiter` ::
  _boolean_, default: `true` +
  By default, we apply a limiter to the flow-field reconstruction.

`config.extrema_clipping` ::
  _boolean_, default: `true` +
  By default, we do extrema clipping at end of each scalar-field reconstruction.
  Setting `config.extrema_clipping=false` suppresses clipping.

`config.thermo_interpolator` ::
  _string_, default: `'rhou'` +
  String to choose the set of interpolation variables to use in the interpolation,
  options are `'rhou'`, `'rhop'`, `'rhoT'` and `'pT'`.


== Flux calculator

[[hortizontal]]
`config.flux_calculator` ::
  _string_, default: `'adaptive_hanel_ausmdv'` +
  Selects the flavour of the flux calculator.
  Options are:

  - `'efm'` A cheap and very diffusive scheme by Pullin and Macrossan.
    For most hypersonic flows, it is too diffusive to be used for the whole flow field
    but it does work very nicely in conjunction with AUSMDV,
    especially for example, in the shock layer of a blunt-body flow.

  - `'ausmdv'` A good all-round scheme with low-diffusion for supersonic flows.

  - `'adaptive_efm_ausmdv'` A blend of the low-dissipation AUSMDV scheme
     for the regions away from shocks
     with the much more diffusive EFM used for cell interfaces near shocks.
     It seems to work quite reliably for hypersonic flows that are a mix
     of very strong shocks with mixed regions of subsonic and supersonic flow.
     The blend is controlled by the parameters `config.compression_tolerance` and
     `config.shear_tolerance` that are described below.

  - `'ausm_plus_up'` Implemented from the description by MS Liou (2006).
     It should be accurate and robust for all speed regimes.
     It is the flux calculator of choice for very low Mach number flows,
     where the fluid behaviour approaches the incompressible limit.
     For best results, you should set the value of `M_inf`.

  - `'hlle'` The Harten-Lax-vanLeer-Einfeldt (HLLE) scheme.
     It is somewhat dissipative and is the only scheme usable with MHD terms.

  - `'adaptive_hlle_ausmdv'` As for `'adaptive_efm_ausmdv'` but with the dissipative scheme
     being the HLLE flux calculator.

  - `'hanel'` The Hanel-Schwane-Seider scheme, from their 1987 paper.
     It also dissipative and is somewhat better behaved than our EFM implementation.

  - `'adaptive_hanel_ausmdv'` As for `'adaptive_efm_ausmdv'` but with the dissipative scheme
     being the Hanel-Schwane-Seider flux calculator.

  - `'roe'` The Phil Roe's classic linearized flux calculator.

  - `'adaptive_hlle_roe'` A blend of Roe's low-dissipation scheme and
     the more dissipative HLLE flux calculator.

  - `'adaptive_ausmdv_asf'` A blend of Summation-by-Parts method of Fisher (high order,
    low-dissipation scheme) and the ausmdv method.

The default adaptive scheme is a good all-round scheme that uses AUSMDV away from
shocks and Hanel-Schwane-Seider flux calculator near shocks.

Any of the schemes with the prefix `'adaptive'` can be used in a blended mode
if the <<shock_detector_smoothing,`shock_detector_smoothing`>> is enabled.

`config.compression_tolerance` ::
  _float_, default: `-0.30` +
   The value of relative velocity change (normalised by local sound-speed)
   across a cell-interface that triggers the shock-point detector.
   A negative value indicates a compression.
   When an adaptive flux calculator is used and the shock detector is triggered,
   the more-dissipative flux calculation will be used
   in place of the default low-dissipation calculation.
   A value of `-0.05` seems OK for the Sod shock tube and sharp-cone inviscid flow simulations,
   however, a higher value is needed for cases with viscous boundary layers,
   where it is important to not have too much numerical dissipation in the boundary layer region.

`config.shear_tolerance` ::
  _float_, default: `0.20` +
  The value of the relative tangential-velocity change
  (normalised by local sound speed) across a cell-interface that suppresses the use of the
  high-dissipation flux calculator even if the
  shock detector indicates that high-dissipation scheme should be used
  within the adaptive flux calculator.
  The default value is experimentally set at 0.20 to get smooth shocks
  in the stagnation region of bluff bodies.
  A smaller value (say, `0.05`) may be needed to get strongly expanding flows to behave
  when regions of shear are also present.

`config.M_inf` ::
  _float_, default: `0.01` +
  representative Mach number for the free stream.
   Used by the `ausm_plus_up` flux calculator.

[#shock_detector_smoothing]
`config.shock_detector_smoothing` ::
 _int_, default = `0` +
 How many iterations of shock detector averaging. Higher values spread the influence of the shock
 detector further from the shock, increasing numerical dissipation but providing a smoother
 transition between flux calculators in adaptive schemes.

TIP: You can read more about this in the technical note
https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/docs/eilmer/technical-notes/hybrid-fluxes/[Hybrid fluxes, shock detection and smoothing.]


`config.strict_shock_detector` ::
  _boolean_, default: `true` +
  If this is true then any face that is part
  of a cell with S>0 will have its own S value set to 1. This is to
  emulate legacy behaviour and thus defaults to true. For true
  blending of fluxes this should be set to false.

`config.frozen_shock_detector` ::
 _boolean_, default: `false` +
 If set to true, the shock detector field will be frozen after the number of time steps
 prescribed by config.shock_detector_freeze_step. Used to prevent flickering of adaptive
 flux methods between their constituent flux calculators.

`config.shock_detector_freeze_step` ::
 _int_, default: `1000` +
 The time step at which the shock detector field will be frozen.

== Viscous effects

`config.viscous` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  If set `true`, viscous effects will be included in the simulation.

`config.separate_update_for_viscous_terms` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  If set `true`, the update for the viscous transport terms is done separately
  to the update for the convective terms.
  By default the updates are done together in the gas-dynamic update procedure.

`config.viscous_delay` ::
  _float_, default: `0.0` +
  The time (in seconds) to wait before applying the viscous terms.
  This might come in handy when trying to start blunt-body simulations.

`config.viscous_factor_increment` ::
  _float_, default: `0.01` +
  The per-time-step increment of the viscous effects, once simulation time exceeds
  `config.viscous_delay`.

`config.turbulence_model` ::
  _string_, default: `'none'` +
  String specifying which model to use.
  Options are: `'none'` `'k_omega'` `'spalart_allmaras'`

`config.turbulence_prandtl_number` ::
  _float_, default: `0.89`

`config.turbulence_schmidt_number` ::
  _float_, default: `0.75`

`config.max_mu_t_factor` ::
  _float_, default: `300` +
  The turbulent viscosity is limited to laminar viscosity multiplied by this factor.

`config.transient_mu_t_factor` ::
  _float_, default: `1.0`


== Finite-rate thermo-chemistry

`config.reacting` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  Set to `true` to activate the finite-rate chemical reactions.

`config.reactions_file` ::
  _string_, default: `'chemistry.lua'` +
  File name for reaction scheme configuration.

`config.reaction_time_delay` ::
  _float_, default: `0.0` +
  Time after which finite-rate reactions are allowed to start.

`config.reaction_fraction_schedule` ::
  _table of float pairs_, default `{{0.0, 1.0},}` +
  If you want to vary the fraction of the reaction time step per gas-dynamic time step
  as the simulation proceeds,
  you can specify a table of `{time, fraction}` pairs that are interpolated by the solver.
  If the initial flow is likely to have a harsh shock reflection with high temperatures
  and correspondingly high reaction rates, it may be beneficial to discard time accuracy
  and start with a small fraction, increasing it (to a maximum of 1.0) as the flow field settles.
  Outside the specified range of times, the `fraction` will be the closest end-point value.

`config.T_frozen` ::
  _float_, default: `300.0` +
  Temperature (in degrees K) below which reactions are frozen.
  The default value is `300.0` since most reaction schemes seem to be valid for temperatures
  above this, however, you may have good reasons to set it higher or lower.

`config.chemistry_update` ::
  _string_, default: `'split'` +
  Set how the chemistry update is included in the time-marching flow solver algorithm.
  Valid options are: `'split'` to use an operator-splitting approach in which the chemistry
  update may be subcycled at a time step appropriate to the chemistry, conditions and integrator; or
  `'integral'` to include the chemistry as part of the general source term vector for
  the species continuity equations: the result is that flow and chemistry are updated in a single
  time step (usually dictated by a flow-appropriate time step).


== Species Diffusion

`config.mass_diffusion_model` ::
  _string_, default: `'none'` +
  Set the expression for laminar diffusion flux of species along concentration gradients.
  Valid options are: `'none'` (no diffusion) and `'ficks_first_law'` (self explanatory).
  Note that this option is ignored in turbulent flow, where the turbulent diffusivity is
  used instead.

`config.diffusion_coefficient_type` ::
  _string_, default: `'none'` +
  Set the type of formula used to compute the species diffusion coefficients in a
  diffusion enabled simulation.
  Valid options are: `'constant_lewis_number'` (works with any multi-species model),
  `'species_specific_lewis_numbers'` (requires specific gas models), and
  `'binary_diffusion'` (requires specific gas models).
  Note that leaving this parameter as `'none'` in a simulation where
  `config.mass_diffusion_model='ficks_first_law'` will cause a run-time error.

`config.lewis_number` ::
  _float_, default: `1.0` +
  Set the value for the Lewis number, which computes the species diffusion coefficients
  based on the thermal conductivity, in a diffusion enabled simulation with
  `config.diffusion_coefficient_type=constant_lewis_number`.

== Special initialisation

`config.diffuse_wall_bcs_on_init` ::
    _bool_, default: `false` +
    Set to diffuse(/blend) conditions at the wall
    into the flow domain as an initial condition

`config.number_init_passes` ::
    _int_, default: `30` +
    Set how many passes the diffusion is applied.
    Each pass diffuses another layer of cells into domain.
    So 10 passes would effect 10 layers of cells from the wall (in a structured grid).

`config.wall_temperature_on_init` ::
    _float_, default: `-1.0` +
    Set the wall temperature to use when diffusing the wall conditions.
    This value *_must_* be set when an adiabatic wall condition is selected
    since there is no initial guess of the wall temperature.
    If this value is set for a fixed temperature wall, then this value overrides
    the wall temperature for the purposes of this diffusion-style initialisation.
    It does not change the wall temperature selected in the boundary condition.
    A value of `-1.0` indicates that this selection is not active and the wall
    boundary temperature should be used. This is default action.

The following lines are an example of using the diffusion-style initialisation.
We assume an adiabatic wall and give a starting guess of 600.0 K for the wall temperature.
The blending operation is performed 20 times in this example:

 config.diffuse_wall_bcs_on_init = true
 config.number_init_passes = 20
 config.wall_temperature_on_init = 600.0


== Miscellaneous

`config.title` ::
    _string_, default: `"Eilmer4 simulation"` +
    Title for the simulation

`config.adjust_invalid_cell_data` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  Usually, you will want the flow solver to provide
  its best estimate for your flow, however, there are flow situations
  for which the flow solver will not compute physically valid flow data.
  If you encounter a difficult flow situation and are prepared to fudge over a few cells,
  then set this parameter to `true` and `max_invalid_cells` to a non-zero value.
  Be cautious when using this option and use it only when you have exhausted more
  reasoned options.
  If there is a problem that is more than just a difficult patch of flow that will blow by,
  it may allow you to go further into a bad situation and get even more confused
  about what the underlying issue really is.

`config.max_invalid_cells` ::
  _int_, default: `0` +
  The maximum number of bad cells that will be tolerated on decoding conserved quantities.
  If this number is exceeded, the simulation will stop.

`config.report_invalid_cells` ::
  _boolean_, default: `true` +
  If you are stuck with having to fudge over cells, you probably
  will want to know about them until, of course, that you don't.
  Set this parameter to `false` to silence the reports of bad cells being fudged over.

`config.apply_bcs_in_parallel` ::
  _boolean_, default, `true` +
  This will be the fastest calculation, however, some boundary
  conditions, such as the shock-fitting need to cooperate across blocks and
  so will have race conditions if applied in parallel.
  If your simulation has such a boundary condition, set this parameter to `false`
  to favour safety above speed.

`config.udf_source_terms` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  Set to `true` to apply user-defined source terms, as supplied in a Lua file.

`config.udf_source_terms_file` ::
  _string_, default: "dummy-source-terms.txt" +
  Name of the Lua file for the user-defined source terms.

`config.print_count` ::
  _int_, default: `20` +
  Number of time steps between printing status information to the console.

`config.control_count` ::
  _int_, default: `10` +
  Number of time steps between re-parsing the job`.control` file.
  If the job`.control` has been edited, then the new values are used after re-parsing.

`config.MHD` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  Set to `true` to make MHD physics active.

`config.do_temporal_DFT` ::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  Set to `true` to calculate the temporal Discrete Fourier Transform of the pressure
  on a cell-by-cell basis on-the-go.
  Useful for large jobs where storing the number of snapshots required
  for Fourier decomposition is prohibitive.
  Results written to file `DFT/jobName.DFT.bxxxx.tar.gz`,
  with a line containing the real and imaginary components of each Fourier mode
  i.e. Re(A0), Im(A0), Re(A1), Im(A1), ... Im(A_n).
  Requires setting of additional config options `config.DFT_n_modes` and `config.DFT_step_interval`.
  Use of `config.fixed_time_step` is also very strongly recommended, non-fixed time stepping
  will lead to erronous mode amplitudes and phases.

`config.DFT_n_modes` ::
  _int_, default: `5` +
  The number of Fourier modes to be computed in the temporal Discrete Fourier Transform.
  Should be equal to `config.max_steps / config.DFT_step_interval` (see next entry).

`config.DFT_step_interval` ::
  _int_, default: `10` +
  The number of steps between each increment of the temporal Discrete Fourier Transform modes.
  Should be equal to `config.max_steps / config.DFT_n_modes`.


== Special Zones

Sometimes you may wish to apply specific configuration only for a limited region.
There are special zones that can be constructed for turbulence, reactions and ignition
and order of reconstruction.
The region of application is defined by a pair of diagonally-opposing points
that specify the minimum and maximum coordinate values.

  TurbulentZone:new{p0={x=x0, y=y0}, p1={x=x1, y=y1}}

The turbulence model is active throughout the flow
but its effect on the flow field is masked outside of any defined turbulent zones.
This is achieved by the code setting the turbulence viscosity and conductivity to zero
for finite-volume cells that fall outside of all regions defined as a TurbulentZone.
If there are no such defined regions, the whole flow field is allowed to have nonzero turbulence viscosity.

  ReactionZone:new{p0={x=x0, y=y0}, p1={x=x1, y=y1}}

In a flow with an active reaction scheme, this type of zone makes it possible to selectively allow
reactions to proceed, or not.
If the centre of a cell lies within the reaction zone, the finite-rate chemistry is allowed to proceed,
else the species fractions are maintained constant.
If no reaction zones are specified and a reaction scheme is active,
then reactions are permitted for the entire flow field.

  IgnitionZone:new{p0={x=x0, y=y0}, p1={x=x1, y=y1}, T=Tig}

`Tig` controls the reaction rate used for chemical reactions,
without effecting the gas temperature in the flow field.
The rate-controlling temperature is used to evaluate the chemical reaction rates
only within the physical extents of the ignition zone.
The effect of this zone can be limited in time by specifying a nonzero values for
`config.ignition_time_start` and `config.ignition_time_stop`.
While the zone is active, the reaction rates within the zone are altered.
The rate-controlling temperature is typically set to an artificially inflated
value to promote ignition.

  SuppressReconstructionZone:new{p0={x=x0, y=y0}, p1={x=x1, y=y1}}

Inside such a zone, high-order reconstruction of the flow properties is suppressed.
This can sometimes help with difficult flow features, such as an expansion around a sharp corner.

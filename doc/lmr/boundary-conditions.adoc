= Boundary Conditions

To complete a definition of a FluidBlock, boundary conditions for all
block boundaries, need to be specified.
These may be given as a list to the FluidBock constructor or
they may be attached to particular boundaries of an already existing
FluidBlock object.
In the absence of your specification, the default boundary condition
is a slip wall, `WallBC_WithSlip`.


== Walls

=== Slip wall

  WallBC_WithSlip:new{label, group}
  or
  WallBC_WithSlip0:new{label, group}

is used where we want a solid wall with no viscous effects.
The effect of the solid wall is achieved with the use of ghost cells and
an appropriate reflection of the velocity vector.
This is the default boundary condition where no other condition is specified.

`label`::
  _string_, default "" +
  A an optional tag string that may be applied to the boundary.

`group`::
  _string_, default "" +
  A an optional tag string that identifies the group to which this boundary belongs.
  It can be used, at run time and in postprocessing,
  to group the data for several boundaries together.
  This might be for force and moment estimation, for example.

There are variants to the basic wall condition.

  WallBC_WithSlip1:new{label, group}

achieves a similar effect to WallBC_WithSlip0 but without the use of ghost cell data.
To do this, the code makes use of one-sided flux-calculators at the boundary.
You will need to specify this variant of the boundary condition for a moving-grid
simulation where this boundary wall may have non-zero velocity.
The one-sided flux calculators will correctly handle the normal component of the
wall velocity while, effectively, the tangential velocity will be ignored.


  WallBC_WithSlip2:new{label, group}

is Ingo's variant of WallBC_WithSlip for moving mesh simulations for walls
with normal velocity.
It uses ghost cells with appropriate velocity settings.


=== No-slip, fixed-temperature

  WallBC_NoSlip_FixedT:new{Twall, wall_function, catalytic_type, wall_massf_composition, label, group}
  or
  WallBC_NoSlip_FixedT0:new{Twall, wall_function, catalytic_type, wall_massf_composition, label, group}

is used where we want convective and viscous effects to impose a no-slip velocity
condition and a fixed wall temperature.
The convective effect of the solid wall is achieved with the use of ghost cells and
an appropriate reflection of the velocity vector.
We need to set `config.viscous=true` to make the temperature-setting part
of this boundary condition effective.

`Twall`::
  The fixed wall temperature, in degrees K. 

`wall_function`::
  an optional analytical model for the turbulent wall stress and heat transfer, allowing
  the user to scrimp on small grid cells close to the wall. Suitable for use with the
  k-omega turbulence model only.

`catalytic_type`::
  an optional boundary condition used for species transport equations in a reacting 
  simulation. Options are: `none` which assumes no catalytic interaction with the
  wall, `equilibrium` which assumes instantly completed reactions at the wall,
  and `fixed_composition` which sets the mass fractions to a user-defined value.

`catalytic_type`::
  A table of species mass fractions required for `catalytic_type=fixed_composition`.

  `WallBC_NoSlip_FixedT1`

is variant of the boundary condition that does not use ghost cells and
is suitable for moving-grid simulations.

=== No-slip, user-defined temperature

  WallBC_NoSlip_UserDefinedT:new{Twall, wall_function, catalytic_type, wall_massf_composition, label, group}

is similar to the fixed-temperature wall but allows an arbitrary temperature
function to be specified via a lua script. This may be useful for simulating a
heated experimental model, where some specific part of the model is heated by
electrical resistance heating to a known elevatated temperature. Optional
arguments are the same as the fixed temperature case.

`Twall`::
  The name of the lua file used to specify the wall temperature. Inside the code,
  this file is passed to a UserDefinedInterface effect, which takes care of calling
  it once per face in the boundary, for each timestep. For further information, see
  the section regarding user defined interface effects in the PDF User Guide.

=== No-slip, adiabatic

  WallBC_NoSlip_Adiabatic:new{wall_function, catalytic_type, wall_massf_composition, label, group}
  or
  WallBC_NoSlip_Adiabatic0:new{wall_function, catalytic_type, wall_massf_composition, label, group}

is used where we want convective and viscous effects to impose no-slip at the wall
but where there is no heat transfer. Optional arguments are the same as the fixed
temperature case.
We need to set `config.viscous=true` to make this boundary condition effective.


  WallBC_NoSlip_Adiabatic1:new{label, group}

is variant of the boundary condition that does not use ghost cells and
is suitable for moving-grid simulations.


=== Translating-surface, fixed-temperature

  WallBC_TranslatingSurface_FixedT:new{Twall, v_trans, label, group}

is used where we want convective and viscous effects to impose
a specified translating velocity condition and a fixed wall temperature,
in a simulation with no grid motion.
By _translating_ we mean that the (flat) wall is moving tangential to the block boundary
such that the gas velocity is nonzero and aligned with the edge of the (fixed) grid.
We need to set `config.viscous=true` to make this boundary condition fully effective.
An example of use is Couette flow between moving plates.

`Twall`::
  The fixed wall temperature, in degrees K.

`v_trans`::
  _Vector3_, default: {x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0} +
  Vector velocity of the translating wall.
  The value may be specified as a table of three named (x,y,z) components.


=== Translating-surface, adiabatic

  WallBC_TranslatingSurface_Adiabatic:new{v_trans, label, group}

is used where we want convective and viscous effects to impose
a specified translating velocity condition but no heat transfer,
in a simulation with no grid motion.
By _translating_ we mean that the (flat) wall is moving tangential to the block boundary
such that the gas velocity is nonzero and aligned with the edge of the (fixed) grid.
We need to set `config.viscous=true` to make this boundary condition fully effective.

`v_trans`::
  _Vector3_, default: {x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0} +
  Vector velocity of the translating wall.
  The value may be specified as a table of three named (x,y,z) components.


=== Rotating-surface, fixed-temperature

  WallBC_RotatingSurface_FixedT:new{Twall, r_omega, centre, label, group}

is used where we want convective and viscous effects to impose
a specified velocity condition and a fixed wall temperature on a circular or cylindrical
fixed surface.
By _rotating_ we mean that the (curved) wall is moving tangential to the block boundary
such that the gas velocity is nonzero and aligned the edge of the (fixed) grid.
We need to set `config.viscous=true` to make this boundary condition fully effective.

`Twall`::
  The fixed wall temperature, in degrees K.

`r_omega`::
  _Vector3_, default: {x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0} +
  Angular-velocity vector of the wall.
  The value may be specified as a table of three named (x,y,z) components.

`centre`::
  _Vector3_, default: {x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0} +
  Axis about which the wall surface rotates.
  The value may be specified as a table of three named (x,y,z) components.

=== Rotating-surface, adiabatic

  WallBC_RotatingSurface_Adiabatic:new{r_omega, centre, label, group}

is used where we want convective and viscous effects to impose
a specified velocity condition but no heat transfer on a circular or cylindrical
fixed surface.
By _rotating_ we mean that the (curved) wall is moving tangential to the block boundary
such that the gas velocity is nonzero and aligned the edge of the (fixed) grid.
We need to set `config.viscous=true` to make this boundary condition fully effective.

`Twall`::
  The fixed wall temperature, in degrees K.

`r_omega`::
  _Vector3_, default: {x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0} +
  Angular-velocity vector of the wall.
  The value may be specified as a table of three named (x,y,z) components.

`centre`::
  _Vector3_, default: {x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0} +
  Axis about which the wall surface rotates.
  The value may be specified as a table of three named (x,y,z) components.


== In-flow

=== Simple supersonic

  InFlowBC_Supersonic:new{flowState, x0=0.0, y0=0.0, z0=0.0, r=0.0}

is used where we want to specify a fixed (supersonic) in-flow condition
that gets copied into the ghost cells each time step.

`flowState`::
  <<FlowState,_FlowState_>> object that has been constructed earlier in your script.

Optional parameters `x0`, `y0`, `z0` and `r` are used to set a virtual source flow.
This is intended to model the flow from a conical nozzle, where the nominal flow state
is at distance `r` from the virtual source located at `x0`, `y0` and `z0`.
The actual flow state on the inflow faces is computed as a perturbation to this nominal flow state.

=== Static profile

  InFlowBC_StaticProfile:new{fileName, match}

is used where we want to specify an inflow condition that might vary
in a complicated manner across the boundary.
Data for the flow condition, on a per-point basis, is contained in the specified file.
Format will be a header line followed by one sample point per line.
The header line will specify the names of the columns and, at a minimum, be

`pos.x pos.y p T vel.x vel.y`

The data lines will have numerical values for the corresponding quantities.
This format should be compatible with that provided by the sliced output
of the postprocessing programs and also be compatible with gnuplot.
You need all the quanitiies to specify the flow condition from pressure and temperature.
It may be that the file is obtained from an earlier simulation, with a post-processing
option like `--extract-line` used to write the file.
For reference, see the constructor function for the `StaticFlowProfile` class
in the `flowstate.d` module and the sample code `prepare-static-profile.py`
in the `examples/lmr/2D/shock-tube-driven-inflow/` directory.
The actual writing of the example file is only a five lines at the end of that Python script.

Matching of the ghost cells to particular points in the data file is controlled by
the `match` string value,
where the default is to match to the nearest location on all three coordinates
of the ghost-cell position `match="xyz-to-xyz"`.

.Other possible values are
  * `"xyA-to-xyA"` For 2D or 3D simulations, don't care about z-component of position.
  * `"AyA-to-AyA"` For 2D or 3D simulations, care about the y-component of position only.
  * `"xy-to-xR"` Starting with a profile from a 2D simulation,
    map it to a radial profile in a 3D simulation, considering the x-component
    of the position of the ghost cells.
  * `"Ay-to-AR"` Starting with a profile from a 2D simulation,
    map it to a radial profile in a 3D simulation, ignoring the x-component
    of the position of the ghost cells.


=== Transient profile

  InFlowBC_TransientProfile:new{fileName, match}

is used where we want to specify an inflow condition that might vary
in a complicated manner across the boundary and also vary in time.
The data is to be provided as a zip archive,
with the archive containing a `metadata.json` file and one flow-profile file
for each time instant that is specified as part of the metadata.
These files are named `data.0`, `data.1`, etc, where the number represents
the index of each time instant.
The format for these individual flow-profile files is the same as for the
<<_static_profile,`InFlowBC_StaticProfile`>> boundary condition and is compatible with the sliced output
of the postprocessing programs.
For reference, see the constructor function for the `TransientFlowProfile` class
in the `flowstate.d` module and the sample code `prepare-transient-profile.py`
in the `examples/lmr/2D/shock-tube-driven-inflow/` directory.

Matching of the ghost cells to particular points in the data file is controlled by
the `match` string value, as per the `InFlowBC_StaticProfile` boundary condition.


=== Transient

  InFlowBC_Transient:new{fileName}

is used  where we want to specify the time-varying inflow condition at the boundary.
Data for the inflow condition,
at particular time instants and assumed uniform across the full boundary,
is contained in the specified file.
This file has a header line that names the columns with the expected names,
as found in the files written for history points.
The order of the columns is not important.
The data lines follow and need to have sufficient information to be able to
define a flow state from pressure and temperature.
For reference, see the constructor function for the `FlowHistory` class,
found toward the end of the `flowstate.d` module.


=== Constant flux

  InFlowBC_ConstFlux:new{flowState, x0=0.0, y0=0.0, z0=0.0, r=0.0}

is used where we want to specify directly the fluxes of mass, momentum and energy
across the boundary faces.
The fluxes are computed from the supplied <<FlowState,_FlowState_>>.

Optional parameters `x0`, `y0`, `z0` and `r` are used to set a virtual source flow.
This is intended to model the flow from a conical nozzle, where the nominal flow state
is at distance `r` from the virtual source located at `x0`, `y0` and `z0`.
The actual flow state on the inflow faces is computed as a perturbation to this nominal flow state.



=== Shock-fitting

  InFlowBC_ShockFitting:new{flowState, x0=0.0, y0=0.0, z0=0.0, r=0.0}

is used where we want to have the inflow boundary be the location of a bow shock.
The fluxes across the boundary are computed from the supplied flow condition and the boundary
velocities are set to follow the shock.
Note that we need to set `config.moving_grid=true` and select
an appropriate gas-dynamic update scheme for the moving grid.

Optional parameters `x0`, `y0`, `z0` and `r` are used to set a virtual source flow.
This is intended to model the flow from a conical nozzle, where the nominal flow state
is at distance `r` from the virtual source located at `x0`, `y0` and `z0`.
The actual flow state on the inflow faces is computed as a perturbation to this nominal flow state.


=== Isentropic from stagnation

  InFlowBC_FromStagnation:new{stagnationState, fileName,
    direction_type, direction_x, direction_y, direction_z,
    alpha, beta, mass_flux, relax_factor}

is used where we want a subsonic inflow with a particular stagnation pressure and
temperature and a velocity _direction_ at the boundary.
Note that many of the fields are shown with their default values,
so you don't need to specify them.
When applied at each time step, the average local pressure across the block boundary
is used with the stagnation conditions to compute a stream-flow condition.
Depending on the value for `direction_type`, the computed velocity's direction can be set

* `"normal"` to the local boundary,
* `"uniform"` in direction and aligned with direction vector whose components
  are `direction_x`, `direction_y` and `direction_z`
* `"radial"` radially-in through a cylindrical surface using flow angles
  `alpha` and `beta`, or
* `"axial"` axially-in through a circular surface using the same flow angles.

For the case with a nonzero value specified for `mass_flux`,
the current mass flux (per unit area) across the block face
is computed and the nominal stagnation pressure is incremented
such that the mass flux across the boundary relaxes toward the specified value.
Note that when we select a nonzero mass flux, we no longer control the stagnation pressure.
This will be adjusted to give the desired mass flux.
The value for `relax_factor` adjusts the rate of convergence for this feedback mechanism.

Note, that for multi-temperature simulations, all of the temperatures
are set to be the same as the transrotational temperature.
This should usually be a reasonable physical approximation because this boundary condition
is typically used to simulate inflow from a reservoir, and stagnated flow in a reservoir
has ample time to equilibriate at a common temperature.
The implementation of this boundary condition may not be time accurate,
particularly when large waves cross the boundary, however,
it tends to work well in the steady-state limit.

When `mass_flux` is zero and `fileName` is left as the default empty string,
the specified FlowState is used as a constant stagnation condition.
This may be modified by a user-defined function if `fileName` is a non-empty string
that give the name of a Lua script containing a function with the name `stagnationPT`
On every boundary condition application, this function receives a table of data
(including the current simulation time)
and returns values for stagnation pressure and temperature.

Here is a minimal example:
----
function stagnationPT(args)
   -- print("t=", args.t)
   p0 = 500.0e3 -- Pascals
   T0 = 300.0 -- Kelvin
   return p0, T0
end
----
The intention is that the user may program the stagnation pressure
as more interesting functions of time.


== Out-flow


=== Simple flux

  OutFlowBC_Simple:new{}
  or
  OutFlowBC_SimpleFlux:new{}

is used where we want a (mostly) supersonic outflow condition.
It should work with subsonic outflow as well, however, remember that you are
deliberately ignoring information that may propagate into the domain from
the real (physical) region that you have truncated.
The outflow flux is determined from the flow state in the cell just inside the boundary.
If the velocity in that cell tries to produce an influx of mass,
the flux calculation switches to that of an impermeable wall.


=== Simple extrapolation

  OutFlowBC_SimpleExtrapolate:new{xOrder}

is used where we want a (mostly) supersonic outflow condition.
Flow data is effectively copied (`xOrder=0`) or linearly-extrapolated (`xOrder=1`)
from just inside the boundary to the ghost cells just outside the boundary, every time step.
In subsonic flow, this can lead to physically invalid behaviour.
If you encounter strange flow behaviour that seems to start at this boundary and propagate
upstream into your flow domain, try extending your simulated flow domain such that
you eventually have an outflow boundary across which nothing exciting happens.


=== Fixed pressure

  OutFlowBC_FixedP:new{p_outside}

is used where we want something like `OutFlowBC_Simple` but with a specified back pressure.
This can be analogous to a vacuum pump that removes gas at the boundary to maintain
a fixed pressure in the ghost cells.


=== Fixed pressure and temperature

  OutFlowBC_FixedPT:new{p_outside, T_outside}

is like `OutFlowBC_FixedP`, above, but also sets the temperature in the ghost cells.


== In-flow and Out-flow

These boundary conditions can be used on a boundary that allows inflow and outflow.

=== Ambient

  InOutFlowBC_Ambient:new{flowState}

is used where we want to allow the flow to go in or out across the boundary and you are
assuming an ambient flow state outside of the domain.
If the velocity of the cell just inside the boundary is directed outward across the boundary face,
then the interior flow properties are copied into the ghost-cells.
If the cell's flow velocity is directed inward, then the specified (ambient) flow state is copied
into the ghost cells.

`flowState`::
  <<FlowState,_FlowState_>> object that has been constructed earlier in your script.

=== DualState

  InOutFlowBC_DualState:new{flowState1, flowState2, p, n}

is used where we want to allow the flow to go in or out across the boundary and you are
assuming two flow states are present outside of the domain.
Outside the flow domain, the flow states exist either side of a plane defined by 
the point `p` and the normal vector `n`.
`flowState1` exists on the side of the plane in the direction of `n`, while `flowState2` 
is on the other side of that plane.

An example of use is in a domain that has an oblique shock processing the nominal free-stream flow.
The flow before the shock would be `flowState1` and after the shock `flowState2`, with the oblique shock
being coincident with the plane.

If the velocity of the cell just inside the boundary is directed outward across the boundary face,
then the interior flow properties are copied into the ghost-cells.
If the cell's flow velocity is directed inward, then relevant flow state is copied
into the ghost cells.
The relevant flow state is selected based on the location of a few smaple points of the boundary face.
If the face sits across the plane, a blending of the flow states is used.

`flowState1`::
  <<FlowState,_FlowState_>> object that has been constructed earlier in your script.
  On side of plane in the direction of `n`.

`flowState2`::
  <<FlowState,_FlowState_>> object that has been constructed earlier in your script.
  On side of plane in opposite to the direction of `n`.

`p`::
  _Vector3_, default: {x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0} +
  A point on the plane that separates the flow states.
  The value may be specified as a table of three named (x,y,z) components.

`n`::
  _Vector3_, default: {x=0.0, y=1.0, z=0.0} +
  Normal vector to the plane.
  The value may be specified as a table of three named (x,y,z) components.


== Inter-block Exchange

=== Full block-face

  ExchangeBC_FullFace:new{otherBlock, otherFace, orientation,
    reorient_vector_quantities, Rmatrix}

Usually, this boundary condition is applied implicitly, by calling the function
`identifyGridConnections`, for cases where one structured-grid block interfaces with another
and the block boundaries are cleanly aligned,
however, it can be applied manually for cases where you want the flow to be plumbed
from one block face into another and the blocks are not geometrically aligned.
A non-unity transformation matrix, `Rmatrix`,
can be provided for cases where the flow vector quantities need to
be reoriented when they are copied from the other boundary to this one.

Note that this boundary condition is only for structured-grid blocks.
If one or both of the blocks to be joined is based on an unstructured-grid,
you will need to use the following `MappedCell` flavour of the exchange boundary condition.
Also, if you have two structured-grid faces but the cells along each of the faces
do not align, you will also need to use the `MappedCell` flavour.

`otherBlock`::
  _FluidBlock_ object, default: nil +
  A reference to the other block that is joined to this boundary.

`otherFace`::
  _FaceLabel_, default: nil +
  An enum value specifying the face on the other block, from which cell data will be copied.
  Possible values are `north`, `east`, `south`, `west`, `bottom`, `top`.

`orientation`::
  _int_: default: `-1` +
  Although there is only one possible orientation for face-to-face connections in 2D,
  there are 4 possible ways to (rotationally) orient a face-to-face connection in 3D.

`reorient_vector_quantities`::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  If true, vector quantities are multiplied by the `Rmatrix` as they are copied from
  the source cell into the destination ghost cell.

`Rmatrix`::
  _array of float_, default: {1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0} +
  This is a 3-by-3 matrix written in row-major format.
  It is applied, in the usual matrix-vector multiply manner, to vector quantities
  such as velocity and magnetic field.
  The user is responsible for computing appropriate coefficients.


=== Mapped cell

  ExchangeBC_MappedCell:new{transform_position, c0, n, alpha, delta,
    list_mapped_cells, reorient_vector_quantities, Rmatrix}

is something like the `ExchangeBC_FullFace` boundary condition but with a mapping
of destination(ghost)-cell location to source-cell location.
It allows us to stitch boundaries together, even if the cells do not align, one-for-one.
The position of the source cell is computed by taking the position of the ghost cell,
computing the solid-body rotation of `alpha` radians about the axis `n`
through the point `c0`, then adding a displacement `delta`.
This will accommodate general rigid-body transformations.

`c0`::
  _Vector3_, default: {x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0} +
  Centre of rotation for position transformation.

`n`::
  _Vector3_ default: {x=0.0, y=0.0, z=1.0} +
  Axis of rotation for the position transformation.

`alpha`::
  _float_, default: 0.0 +
  Angle of rotation for the position transformation.
  Right-hand rule gives the sense of direction.

`delta`::
  _Vector3_, default: {x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0} +
  Translational displacement for the position transformation.

`list_mapped_cells`::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  Flag to indicate whether we want the program to list the indices of the mapped cells
  as they are located at run time.

`reorient_vector_quantities`::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  If true, vector quantities are multiplied by the `Rmatrix` as they are copied from
  the source cell into the destination ghost cell.

`Rmatrix`::
  _array of float_, default: {1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0} +
  This is a 3-by-3 matrix written in row-major format.
  It is applied, in the usual matrix-vector multiply manner, to vector quantities
  such as velocity and magnetic field.
  The user is responsible for computing appropriate coefficients.


== User Defined
This is a get-out-of-jail boundary condition that allows you to do anything
you wish to code (in Lua).
Please read the Appendix on these boundary conditions in the PDF User Guide before
your first attempt to use them.


=== Setting ghost cells

   UserDefinedGhostCellBC:new{fileName, label, group}

is used to allow the user to define the ghost-cell flow properties and
interface properties at run time.
This is done via a set of functions defined by the user,
written in the Lua programming language, and provided in the specified file.

=== Setting fluxes

  UserDefinedFluxBC:new{fileName, funcName, label, group}

is used to allow the user to define the interface convective-fluxes at run time.
This is done via a function defined by the user, written in the Lua programming language,
and provided in the specified file.
If the user does not specify the function name,
`convectiveFlux` is used as the default name.

=== Full block-face followed by user-defined

  ExchangeBC_FullFacePlusUDF:new{otherBlock, otherFace, orientation,
    reorient_vector_quantities, Rmatrix, fileName, label, group}

is used when you might conditionally want to exchange block-boundary data
or do something else altogether.
This boundary condition allows that by first doing a FullFace exchange of data and then
calling upon your user-defined functions (as for `UserDefinedGhostCellBC`)
to conditionally overwrite the data.
This turns out to be a convenient way to implement diaphragm models
for shock-tunnel simulations.
Note that this boundary condition can work across MPI tasks
but is only implemented for structured-grid blocks.

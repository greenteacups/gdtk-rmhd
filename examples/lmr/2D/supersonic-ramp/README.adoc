This example is of supersonic flow over a ramp.
This test case has been taken from the paper by Marques et al. (2004).
The ramp has been discretised by a grid of unstructured triangular elements.
The example was set up with the following conditions:

++++
M_{\infty} = 2.0; \quad \rho_{\infty} = 1.0 ~~ kg\cdot m^{-3};  \quad T_{\infty} = 300.0 ~~ K; \quad \gamma = 1.4

This example is of supersonic flow over a convex corner: a Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan.
It is test case B.1 "Prandtl-Meyer Expansion Fan" in the paper by Ghia et al. (2010).
This particular example was set up by Kyle Damm with conditions to match the example in Ghia et al.:

M_{\infty} = 2.0; \quad \delta = -10.0^{\circ}; \quad \gamma = 1.4

== Description of subdirectories

This test case is used to test the basics of single block and multi-block configurations,
and how to run those multi-block configurations with distributed-memory or shared-memory parallelism.
One can also test the various file formats ("rawbinary" or "gziptext") by setting an environment
variable locally before running an example. For example:

   > LMR_FILE_FORMAT=gziptext make prep

If the environment variable is unset, the example defaults to using "rawbinary".
The subdirectories are described here:

`single-block`:: The convex corner is represented by a single block.
`two-block-shared-memory`:: The convex corner is represented by two blocks, split at the corner.
This case is set up to run using shared-memory parallelism.
`two-block-mpi`:: As for the `two-block-shared-memory` however the case is set up to run using MPI
in a distributed memory manner.

These examples form part of our verification suite using the Method of Manufactured Solutions.
Specifically, we have manufactured solutions to test: Euler terms; Navier-Stokes terms; and
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes modelling with the latexmath:[k-\omega] turbulence model.
These manufactured solutions are steady so they serve to exercise the spatial discretisation.

This example is somewhat advanced: it makes heavy use of the user-defined customization
points such as boundary conditions and source terms.
It also shows how to provide a reference solution for use in post-processing.

[TIP]
====
This example contains:

. Scripted coordination (using Python) to run a series of simulations on
grids of various refinement
. Use of user-defined boundary conditions and use of user-defined source terms
. Demonstration of the `compute-norms` command to find error norms through provision
of a reference solution

== Description of subdirectories

The subdirectories are divided according to the mathematical description of
fluid flow that we attempt to solve numerically.
Those eponymous subdirectories are:

`euler`:: This manufactured solution is a smooth, purely supersonic, inviscid flow
for testing the Euler solver mode in `Eilmer`.
`navier-stokes`:: This manufactured solution tests the diffusive terms
(along with the convective) through use of a highly-inflated viscosity value.
The flow field is smooth and subsonic.
`rans-k-omega`:: *`[TODO]`*

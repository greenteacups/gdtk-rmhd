This example simulates the flow of air over a sphere.
It is an example of using the two-temperature air model for high-speed flow.
The particular conditions are chosen to replicate the physical experiments performed by Nonaka et al. (2000).
Those conditions are Case 18 in Table 1.
These conditions were chosen because they align with Figure 10 in their article.
Figure 10 is one of the only cases where the full shock shape was reported.
Having access to the full shock shape is very useful for validation.
The conditions of this case are:

* sphere radius : 7mm
* free stream velocity : 3490 m/s
* free stream pressure : 4850 Pa
* free stream temperature : 293.0 K (assumed, not stated)
* free stream composition : f_N2 = 0.767, f_O2 = 0.233

A comparison of the computed shock shape to the experiment is shown here.

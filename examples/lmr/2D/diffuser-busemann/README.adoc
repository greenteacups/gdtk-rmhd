= Supersonic flow through a Busemann diffuser

This example is of supersonic flow ithrough a Busemann diffuser.
The particular example comes from the paper by Moelder (2003).
The total pressure recovery is a measure of efficiency for the
diffuser.
Here, that value is: latexmath:[\Pi = p_{t3}/p_{t1} = 0.9582].
A Busemann diffuser can be characterised by the Mach numbers at:
inflow (M1),
just before the conical/terminating shock (M2),
and just after this shock (M3).
For this example, those values are:

++++
M_1 = 5.77; \quad M_2 = 3.00; \quad M_3 = 2.48
++++

[TIP]
====
This example:

. Uses the `busemann.py` module from the Python `gdtk` package to generate the diffuser contour.
. Has coarse-grid to fine-grid sequencing; it shows how to warm-start the fine-grid from coarse-grid solution.
. Shows the use of the `ControlPointPatch` with a "channel" guide patch.

The simulation is axisymmetric so only top-half of images is used in simulation in domain.
The white mesh overlay are the control points of the `ControlPointPatch`, not the grid.
The grid is much much finer in resolution.

The top image shows how the diffuser acts to reduce Mach number.
The bottom image, displaying total pressure, shows how most of the compression
is isentropic until the terminating (conical) shock is encountered.
